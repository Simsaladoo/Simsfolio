# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I'm David, a Unreal Engine-focused technical artist with a background in pipeline tools and development. For the last 9 years I've worked on films, commercials, video game trailers, and VR games. Learning Sharepoint in C# was my gateway into programming during my early career years at NASA, and since then the diverse projects I've worked on have given me a wealth of experience and perspective.  Nearly a decade of experience using Blueprints, Python, C++, engine optimization with Insights and visual studio, learning pipeline APIs, as well as implementing shader tricks and master materials, post-processing, creating stage tools and look-dev.
